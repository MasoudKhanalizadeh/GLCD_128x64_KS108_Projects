# KS0108 GLCD Example with Backlight Control

This repository demonstrates how to interface a **KS0108-based GLCD** with an **Arduino** to display text using a custom font and control the backlight for a blinking effect.

---

## Features

- **GLCD Initialization**: Proper setup and initialization of the KS0108 display.
- **Custom Font Rendering**: Displays text with the `FreeSerif12pt7b` font from the `Adafruit_GFX` library.
- **Backlight Control**: Manages backlight behavior via a digital output pin.
- **Text Display**: Clears and updates the screen with text in a loop.

---

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
1. Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, etc.)
2. KS0108 GLCD Display
3. Resistor for backlight control (if needed)
4. Jumper wires for connections

### Software
Ensure the following libraries are installed in the Arduino IDE:
1. [`Adafruit_GFX`](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
2. [`KS0108_GLCD`](https://github.com/your-repo-for-KS0108-library)
3. Built-in Fonts library (included in Adafruit GFX).

## Code Overview

This project initializes the GLCD display, renders text ("Hello World!") with a custom font, and manages the backlight's on/off behavior. The backlight blinks to create a visual effect.

### Setup
1. Serial communication is initialized for debugging.
2. The display is cleared on startup.
3. The backlight pin is set to HIGH initially to turn it on.

### Loop
- The GLCD displays "Hello World!" at a fixed position.
- Backlight toggles on/off to blink every second.
- The display is cleared and updated continuously.

## Installation and Usage

### Steps:
1. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository or download the `.zip` file.
2. **Connect Hardware**: Wire the KS0108 GLCD display to the Arduino as described above.
3. **Install Libraries**:
   - Install `Adafruit_GFX` via the Arduino Library Manager.
   - Install `KS0108_GLCD` from the provided source.
4. **Upload Code**: Open the provided sketch in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your board.
5. **Run**: Watch the "Hello World!" text appear on the display with the backlight blinking.

## Example Output

When successfully run:
- The GLCD displays **"Hello World!"** in the `FreeSerif12pt7b` font.
- The backlight toggles on/off every second, creating a blinking effect.

---

## Dependencies

This project relies on:
1. **Adafruit GFX Library**: For font rendering and drawing functions.
2. **KS0108_GLCD Library**: For driving the KS0108 display controller.
3. **FreeSerif12pt7b**: A custom font included in the `Adafruit_GFX` library.
