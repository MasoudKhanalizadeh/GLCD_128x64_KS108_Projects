# Temperature and Humidity Display with Arduino

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **temperature and humidity display** using a KS0108 graphical LCD 128*64 and a DHT11 sensor with an Arduino. The data is displayed in real-time on the screen, showing temperature in Celsius and humidity in percentage.

### Features
- **Real-time Environmental Data**: Displays temperature and humidity readings in real-time.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the sensor fails to provide data.

## Software Setup

### Libraries Required
Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:
1. `Adafruit GFX` - For graphics rendering.
2. `KS0108_GLCD` - For controlling the graphical LCD.
3. `DHT` - For interfacing with the DHT11 sensor.

To install these libraries:
1. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
2. Search for each library by name and click **Install**.

### Code
The full source code for this project is available in the `temp_humidity_display.ino` file. Upload the code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

---

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
   - The DHT sensor and GLCD are initialized during the `setup()` phase.
   - The GLCD is cleared and prepared for display.
2. **Real-time Display**:
   - The temperature and humidity readings are fetched from the DHT11 sensor.
   - These values are displayed on the screen in a clean and readable format.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the sensor fails to provide data, an error message is displayed.

---

## Adjustments

### Customizing Fonts
- To use a different font for the display, change this line in the code:
  ```cpp
  display.setFont(&FreeSerif12pt7b);
  ```
- Replace `FreeSerif12pt7b` with another font available in the Adafruit GFX library.

### Refresh Rate
- Adjust the refresh rate by changing the `delay` value in the `loop` function:
  ```cpp
  delay(2000); // Adjust the delay for faster or slower updates.
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **GLCD Not Displaying Properly**:
   - Check the wiring and ensure all connections match the table above.
   - Ensure the `KS0108_GLCD` library is correctly installed.
2. **Sensor Errors**:
   - Ensure the DHT11 sensor is properly connected to 5V, GND, and the data pin.
   - Replace the sensor if it continues to return `NaN` values.
