# Scrolling Text Display with Arduino

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **scrolling text display** on a KS0108 graphical LCD using an Arduino. It combines dynamic scrolling text with a blinking message effect, as well as temperature and humidity readings from a DHT11 sensor.

### Features
- **Scrolling Text**: A custom message scrolls from right to left across the screen.
- **Blinking Message**: When the scrolling text exits the screen, an alternate message blinks three times.
- **Environmental Data**: Displays real-time temperature and humidity readings from a DHT11 sensor.

## Software Setup

### Libraries Required
Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Arduino IDE:
1. `Adafruit GFX` - For graphics rendering.
2. `KS0108_GLCD` - For controlling the graphical LCD.
3. `DHT` - For interfacing with the DHT11 sensor.

To install these libraries:
1. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
2. Search for each library by name and click **Install**.

### Code
The full source code for this project is available in the `scrolling_text.ino` file. Upload the code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

---

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
   - The DHT sensor and GLCD are initialized during the `setup()` phase.
   - The GLCD is cleared and prepared for display.
2. **Scrolling Text**:
   - The message "Hi Masoud! You can do it Keep going!" scrolls from right to left.
   - When the message fully exits the screen, it triggers the blinking message sequence.
3. **Blinking Message**:
   - The message "Just Do It!" blinks three times before resuming the scrolling text.
4. **Environmental Data**:
   - The temperature and humidity values are updated and displayed on the screen.

---

## Adjustments

### Customizing Text
- To change the scrolling or blinking messages, modify these lines in the code:
  ```cpp
  display.print(F("Hi Masoud! You can do it Keep going!"));
  blinkText("Just Do It!", 20, 30, 3, 1000, 250);
  ```

### Speed Control
- Adjust the scrolling speed by changing the `textX` decrement value:
  ```cpp
  textX -= 3; // Change the value for faster or slower scrolling.
  ```
- Modify the blink delay in the `blinkText` function:
  ```cpp
  delay(delayTime1); // Adjust the delay time for blinking.
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **GLCD Not Displaying Properly**:
   - Check the wiring and ensure all connections match the table above.
   - Ensure the `KS0108_GLCD` library is correctly installed.
2. **Sensor Errors**:
   - Ensure the DHT11 sensor is properly connected to 5V, GND, and the data pin.
   - Replace the sensor if it continues to return `NaN` values.
3. **Text Clipping or Overflow**:
   - Ensure the text length is appropriate for the screen dimensions.

## Preview
- **Scrolling Message**: Displays a dynamic message moving from right to left.
- **Blinking Text**: An encouraging message appears when scrolling completes.
- **Live Data**: Real-time environmental readings for added functionality.
